# Filter Research Notes

## 2026-05-17: Wang 2020/2019 shadow-removal preprocessing before white-black not adopted

- [2] Wang, B. and Chen, C.P., 2019. An effective background estimation method for shadows removal of document images.

Tested two docs-side white-black variants:

- `[1]+白黒`: approximate local/global background color shadow removal before the existing white-black pipeline.
- `[2]+白黒`: approximate effective background estimation and tone adjustment before the existing white-black pipeline.

Result: neither variant was effective enough to keep. The existing white-black pipeline already does flat-field correction and local-mean normalization, so adding a traditional shadow-removal pass before it mostly produced small binarization differences. In several samples the variants slightly increased black pixels, wrinkle marks, or fine-line darkness instead of cleaning the background.

Sample-specific notes:

- `report-clean-paper-ios`: `[2]+白黒` increased black specks and wrinkle marks; `[1]+白黒` was closer to existing but not cleaner.
- `report-noisy-bw-android`: both variants left the major fold/shadow artifacts; `[2]+白黒` added more dark pixels.
- `math-cheat-sheet`, `tax`, `notepad`, and `whiteboard-kazakoshi`: variants tended to darken fine structure or ruled lines slightly without improving readability.
- `report-kids-poster-color`: `[1]+白黒` reduced some filled dark texture, but this was content-specific and did not offset the regressions.

Decision: revert the docs filter sections, Python prototype code, and generated comparison assets. Keep only this note; do not move either preprocessing step into Android/iOS.

## 2026-05-17: White-black noise reduction prototypes not adopted

Tested two docs-side white-black filter variants for reducing noise after binarization:

- `DenoiseColorImageBasedOnRollBall`-inspired rolling-ball background estimation.
- `ReflectBinaryColorShift*BG`-inspired stronger background normalization.

Result: neither prototype was useful enough to keep in the filter documentation or move into Android/iOS. On the noisy report sample, the rolling-ball variant slightly reduced some small black components, but the visual improvement was minor. The Reflect BG variant was even closer to the existing white-black output. Stronger inverted-background normalization was also checked briefly, but it made wrinkles and dirt on otherwise clean paper more likely to turn into black noise.

Decision: keep the existing white-black pipeline for now. Do not re-add these prototypes to `docs/src/pages/filters.astro` unless there is a new implementation detail or a new sample set that materially changes the result.

## 2026-05-17: Structure-connected small black dot cleanup not adopted

Tested a docs-side white-black post-processing variant that removed small black connected components when they were not near larger text-like or line-like black components. The intent was to keep punctuation, dakuten, and nearby text fragments while removing isolated wrinkle or dirt specks.

Result: the effect was limited on the noisy white-black samples. It reduced some small components, but the visible improvement was minor. The first version also removed dotted guide lines in the timetable sample because the dotted lines were interpreted as isolated small black components. A follow-up protection rule for dotted horizontal/vertical structures reduced that side effect, but the overall benefit remained too small to justify keeping the prototype.

Decision: do not keep this prototype in `docs/src/pages/filters.astro`, and do not move it into Android/iOS. Revisit only if there is a stronger text-structure classifier or a sample set where isolated black speck removal is clearly valuable without damaging dotted forms or faint writing.
